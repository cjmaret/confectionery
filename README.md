## Project Description / Functionality:
This site is a video portfolio for a filmmaking company based in NYC. The site uses an exceptionally innovative single-player layout overlaid on an image of a 'truffle box' player on a film set.

The user can click on a 'truffle' and watch video/film demos from within that truffle category. The truffle groups are individual players in a carousel, allowing the user to slide between videos, by pressing the next/previous buttons, clicking on the indicator buttons, or swiping through (on mobile).

Having differently lit backgrounds and timed fade-ins gives a cinematic feel to the experience. Aside from the video truffles, the user can also view a card-carousel, or an external website, all of which are featured inside the truffle 'video' tin.

The site is hosted on Netlify, and connected to Contentful, from which the client can add, delete, or change the order of the videos, and the video carousels will expand or shrink dynamically to accommodate the number of videos in that group.
